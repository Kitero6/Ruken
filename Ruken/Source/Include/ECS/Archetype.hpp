/**
 * \brief Archetypes are at the very core of this ECS implementation.
 *        They are responsible for storing and organizing the components
 *        so that systems can query and work on those in the most efficient way.
 *
 * An archetype is a unique set of arrays, each array being used to store one (and one only) type of component.
 * All these arrays are ordered so that all components at a given index correspond to the same entity;
 * and so, all entities stored in a given archetype share the exact same set of components.
 * By storing the components in contiguous homogeneous arrays, the systems can iterate on them very efficiently,
 * leveraging the hardware pre-fetcher to its fullest potential.
 *
 * \note This has a very important implication: each time the structure of an entity is modified
 *       (i.e. each time we add or remove a component to an entity), it must be memmoved to another archetype.
 *       This has a cost, especially if doing this on lots of entities very frequently.
 *       Take this fact into consideration when designing your code.
